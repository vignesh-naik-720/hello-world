# hello-world
Hello Guys! Welcome to my GitHub Account! This repository is for me to introduce myself.<br><br>
I am a <strong>Computer Engineering Undergrad from Goa.</strong><br>
I study in <strong>Agnel Institute of Technology and Design.</strong>

This is where my journey starts on GitHub.<br> I want to learn and practice Web development, AI/ML and cloud computing.<br><br>
My principal non-tech interests include designing mobile and web interfaces, writing poetry and pen sketching for relaxation.
